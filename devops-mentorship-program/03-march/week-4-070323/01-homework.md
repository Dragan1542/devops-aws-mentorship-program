## üìÖ Date: 07.03.2023.      

For week-4 you need to go over our üìù [Class Notes](https://github.com/allops-solutions/devops-aws-mentorship-program/blob/main/devops-mentorship-program/03-march/week-4-070323/00-class-notes.md#-class-notes) and read them carefully. 

Also you need to watch and read materials inside üìù **Class Notes** -> üìñ [Reading materials](https://github.com/allops-solutions/devops-aws-mentorship-program/blob/main/devops-mentorship-program/03-march/week-4-070323/00-class-notes.md#-reading-materials)

The outcomes of this task should be the following:
- You need to know what the OSI model is
- What protocols are
- IPv4 addressing (being able to create your own subnet), for example, if you have a CIDR block `10.0.0.0/24` and you are asked to create 2 subnets that belong to that CIDR block, where you will have 128 IP addresses available in each subnet you should be able to do subnetting manually using pen and paper. 
- Difference between private and public IPv4 addresses
- What is IPv6, why we need IPv6 and what is main difference between IPv4 and IPv6
- What is a client-server architecture
- Who is the client and who is server
- What is the TCP protocol
- What is HTTP protocol and why we are using it
- What is the main difference between TCP and UDP protocols
- What is FQDN
- What is DNS, why do we need it, how it works
- What is VPN

If you carefully go over  üìù **Class Notes** and üìñ **Reading materials** you should not have an issue answering questions from above.
