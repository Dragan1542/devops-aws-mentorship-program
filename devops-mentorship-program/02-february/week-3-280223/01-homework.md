## üìÖ Date: 28.02.2023.    

For the week-3 task you need to do following.

Read `Chapter 13`, `Chapter 14`, `Chapter 15`, and `Chapter 16` from the book **Linux Command Line and Shell Scripting Bible, 3rd Edition**.
The book is available for download inside our [Class Notes](/devops-mentorship-program/02-february/week-2-280223/00-class-notes.md) reading materials.

As you read the chapters you will notice different scripts. You need to do following:
- Log in into the host `3.68.91.255` via `ssh centos@3.68.91.255` and create directory called: `firstname-lastname-week-3`  
- Create .sh files for each script and execute scripts  
- Take screenshots after executing scripts  
- Push all scripts to your GitHub repository inside the folder `week-3`

**NOTE: If you have an option to run scripts on your own host you dont need to execute them on our host. You can run them on your own host and take screenshots.**

**TIER 1 ONLY** Create a pull request and post it as a comment on this issue. Inside the pull request, you need to post screenshots from step 3 so that we have confirmation you actually executed scripts.
you need to execute each script at our centos server `ssh centos@3.68.91.255` or on your own host.
